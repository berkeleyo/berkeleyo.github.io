I'm **Berkeley O**, a Lead Cloud & DevOps Engineer. I build secure, automated platforms and ship pragmatic solutions:
- Azure & GCP landing zones, network & identity architecture.
- CI/CD with GitHub Actions, IaC with Terraform, container platforms (AKS/GKE).
- Security: Entra ID, Conditional Access, SentinelOne, SIEM integrations, hardened egress.
